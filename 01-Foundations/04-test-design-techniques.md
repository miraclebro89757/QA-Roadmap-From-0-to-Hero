# Test Design Techniques

Test design techniques help create effective test cases. Common techniques include:

## Black-box Testing
Focuses on input/output without knowing internal code.

## White-box Testing
Requires knowledge of the internal code structure.

## Grey-box Testing
Combines both black-box and white-box approaches.

## Other Techniques
- Equivalence Partitioning
- Boundary Value Analysis
- Decision Table Testing
- State Transition Testing

Using these techniques ensures thorough and efficient testing.
