## The Story Behind My English Name

As a native Chinese speaker, I didn’t have an English name for a long time. When I decided to open source this QA roadmap and share my journey with a global audience, I wanted a name that would be easy to remember and pronounce for English speakers, while still feeling connected to my Chinese identity.

After considering several options, I chose the name "Jay" because it sounds similar to my family name "Zhai" and is a friendly, approachable name in English. This name represents my willingness to connect with people from different backgrounds and my commitment to continuous learning and sharing.

So, from now on, you can call me Jay Zhai!
