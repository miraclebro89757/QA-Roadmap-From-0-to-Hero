## ï¿½ï¿½ How ATS Works

### **1. Resume Collection**
- Receives resumes from job boards, company websites, email
- Stores applications in a centralized database

### **2. Resume Parsing**
- Extracts information from resumes (contact details, skills, experience)
- Converts unstructured data into searchable format

### **3. Keyword Matching**
- Scans resumes for relevant keywords from job descriptions
- Ranks candidates based on keyword match percentage

### **4. Screening & Ranking**
- Filters out resumes that don't meet basic requirements
- Ranks remaining candidates by relevance score

### **5. Human Review**
- Only top-ranked resumes reach human recruiters
- Many resumes never get seen by humans
