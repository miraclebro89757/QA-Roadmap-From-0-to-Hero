### **ATS Resume Screening Tips**

The core principle of ATS screening is to **make your resume easy and accurate for a machine to read.**

1.  **Keyword Matching**: This is the most crucial factor for ATS screening.
    * **Method**: Carefully study the job description (JD) of the position you are applying for. Strategically integrate key skills, tools, technologies, responsibilities, and years of experience mentioned in the JD into your resume. For example, if the JD mentions "JIRA," "Selenium," "CI/CD," "Python," and "Performance Testing," your resume must also include these terms.
    * **Tip**: Use terminology that matches the JD exactly. For instance, if the JD uses "QA Automation Engineer," it is best to use that same phrase rather than just "Test Engineer."

2.  **Resume Format and Structure**: ATS prefers clean, standardized formats.
    * **Avoid**: Complex tables, multi-column layouts, images, icons, fancy fonts, and key information in headers or footers. These can all cause parsing errors for the ATS.
    * **Recommended**: Use clear headings (e.g., `WORK EXPERIENCE`, `SKILLS`, `EDUCATION`), standard bullet point lists (`â€¢`), and a left-to-right reading order.

3.  **File Format**:
    * **Recommended**: **PDF format**. A PDF keeps your resume's formatting consistent across different devices. However, ensure your PDF is text-based, not a scanned image.
    * **Avoid**: Image formats like JPEG or PNG, as the ATS cannot read the text within them. While Word documents (.doc/.docx) can be read by an ATS, they may have formatting issues due to version compatibility.

4.  **Content Clarity**:
    * **Capitalization**: Proper nouns and tool names should use correct capitalization, such as "Python," "Jira," and "Docker."
    * **Avoid Acronyms**: Unless an acronym is very common (e.g., "QA," "CI/CD"), it's best to use the full term followed by the acronym, for example, "Test-Driven Development (TDD)."

### **Font Selection**

The ATS doesn't have a strict preference for fonts themselves, but it favors **clear, easy-to-read fonts** to minimize parsing errors.

* **Recommended Fonts**:
    * **Sans-serif fonts**: **Arial, Calibri, Helvetica, Verdana**

* **Tip**: I personally recommend using a sans-serif font, as they are easier to read on a screen and have a more modern, clean appearance.

* **Font Size**:
    * Body text: I recommend a font size of **10-12 points**.
    * Headings: Can be slightly larger, **14-16 points**.
    * Ensure a consistent font size throughout.

* **Avoid Fonts**:
    * Fancy, handwritten, artistic, or uncommon fonts, as these may not be recognized by the ATS.

### **Font Color**

* **Does color matter?**
    * **Yes, it does.** To put it simply, you should use as little color on your resume as possible.

* **Recommended Color**:
    * **Pure black**. This is the safest and most professional choice. Pure black text on a white background provides the highest contrast for the ATS to read accurately.

* **Avoid Colors**:
    * Overly bright or light colors like red, green, or yellow. These can affect contrast, making it difficult for the ATS to read accurately.

### **Resume PDF Naming Conventions**

A good resume PDF filename should follow these principles: **professional, easily identifiable, and easy to manage.**

**Most Recommended Naming Format**

* **`[Your Full Name] - Resume.pdf`**
* **Benefits**: The clearest, most universal, and most professional format.
* **Example**: `Lucas Zhai - Resume.pdf`

**Job-Specific Naming Format**

* **`[Your Full Name] - [Job Title] - Resume.pdf`**
* **Benefits**: Helps recruiters quickly associate your resume with the specific position they are hiring for.
* **Example**: `Lucas Zhai - Senior Software Test Engineer - Resume.pdf`

**Date-Included Naming Format**

* **`[Your Full Name] - Resume - [YYYY-MM-DD].pdf`**
* **Benefits**: Useful for self-management and shows the recruiter the recency of your resume.
* **Example**: `Lucas Zhai - Resume - 2025-08-10.pdf`

### **Summary**

I recommend the naming format: **`[Your Full Name] - Resume.pdf`**. It is simple, direct, professional, and meets the requirements of most companies.
