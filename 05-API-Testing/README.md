## üí° Tips for Success

### **1. Start with Manual Testing**
- Use tools like Postman to manually explore APIs
- Understand the API behavior before automating
- Document your findings and test scenarios

### **2. Focus on Real APIs**
- Practice with public APIs (Twitter, GitHub, etc.)
- Build your own test APIs for learning
- Work with APIs in real projects

### **3. Understand the Business Logic**
- Learn what the API is supposed to do
- Understand the data flow and relationships
- Test both happy path and edge cases

### **4. Master the Tools**
- Become proficient with at least one API testing tool
- Learn command-line tools for automation
- Understand how to integrate with CI/CD

### **5. Practice Performance Testing**
- Start with simple load tests
- Learn to interpret performance metrics
- Understand the impact of performance on user experience
