# Whatâ€™s the Difference Between QA and Software Tester?

**QA (Quality Assurance):**
- Focuses on improving and ensuring the quality of processes used to create software.
- Involves activities like process definition, audits, training, and continuous improvement.
- Proactive: aims to prevent defects before they occur.

**Software Tester:**
- Focuses on finding bugs and verifying that the software works as intended.
- Involves executing test cases, reporting bugs, and validating fixes.
- Reactive: detects defects after the software is developed.

**Summary:**
- QA is about building quality into the process; a software tester is about checking the quality of the product.
- QA is process-oriented; software testing is product-oriented.
