# Performance Testing

Performance testing is a critical aspect of QA that ensures applications meet performance requirements under various conditions. It helps identify bottlenecks, optimize resource usage, and ensure a smooth user experience.

## üéØ What is Performance Testing?

Performance testing evaluates how a system performs under specific workloads and conditions. It measures response times, throughput, resource utilization, and scalability to ensure the application meets performance requirements.

### **Key Performance Testing Concepts:**
- **Response Time:** Time taken to respond to a request
- **Throughput:** Number of requests processed per unit time
- **Concurrency:** Number of users/requests handled simultaneously
- **Scalability:** Ability to handle increased load
- **Reliability:** System stability under load
- **Resource Utilization:** CPU, memory, network, disk usage

## üöÄ Types of Performance Testing

### **1. Load Testing**
- **Purpose:** Test system behavior under expected load
- **Focus:** Normal and peak load conditions
- **Goal:** Verify system can handle expected user traffic
- **Example:** Test X (Twitter) with 10,000 concurrent users

### **2. Stress Testing**
- **Purpose:** Test system behavior beyond normal capacity
- **Focus:** Breaking point and recovery
- **Goal:** Find system limits and failure points
- **Example:** Test X (Twitter) with 50,000 concurrent users

### **3. Spike Testing**
- **Purpose:** Test system response to sudden load increases
- **Focus:** Rapid load changes
- **Goal:** Verify system handles traffic spikes
- **Example:** Test X (Twitter) during major events

### **4. Endurance Testing**
- **Purpose:** Test system over extended periods
- **Focus:** Memory leaks, resource degradation
- **Goal:** Verify long-term stability
- **Example:** Test X (Twitter) for 24 hours continuously

### **5. Volume Testing**
- **Purpose:** Test with large amounts of data
- **Focus:** Database performance, storage limits
- **Goal:** Verify system handles data volume
- **Example:** Test X (Twitter) with millions of tweets

### **6. Scalability Testing**
- **Purpose:** Test system's ability to scale
- **Focus:** Horizontal and vertical scaling
- **Goal:** Verify growth capacity
- **Example:** Test X (Twitter) with increasing user base
