# Security Testing

Security testing is a critical component of QA that ensures applications are protected against vulnerabilities, threats, and attacks. In today's digital landscape, security is not just an afterthought‚Äîit's a fundamental requirement.

## üéØ What is Security Testing?

Security testing is the process of evaluating the security posture of software applications to identify vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and potential threats that could compromise data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.

### **Key Security Testing Concepts:**
- **Confidentiality:** Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized users
- **Integrity:** Maintaining data accuracy and consistency
- **Availability:** Ensuring systems are accessible when needed
- **Authentication:** Verifying user identity
- **Authorization:** Controlling access to resources
- **Non-repudiation:** Ensuring actions cannot be denied

## üõ°Ô∏è Types of Security Testing

### **1. Vulnerability Assessment**
- **Purpose:** Identify known vulnerabilities in applications
- **Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Nessus, OpenVAS
- **Focus:** Automated scanning for common security issues

### **2. Penetration Testing (Pen Testing)**
- **Purpose:** Simulate real-world attacks to find security weaknesses
- **Approach:** Manual testing by security experts
- **Types:** Black box, white box, gray box testing

### **3. Security Code Review**
- **Purpose:** Analyze source code for security vulnerabilities
- **Tools:** SonarQube, Checkmarx, Veracode
- **Focus:** Static analysis of code for security issues

### **4. API Security Testing**
- **Purpose:** Test APIs for security vulnerabilities
- **Focus:** Authentication, authorization, input validation, rate limiting
- **Tools:** Postman, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP

### **5. Mobile Security Testing**
- **Purpose:** Test mobile apps for security vulnerabilities
- **Focus:** Data storage, network communication, permissions
- **Tools:** MobSF, Drozer, Frida

### **6. Infrastructure Security Testing**
- **Purpose:** Test network and infrastructure security
- **Focus:** Firewalls, servers, databases, cloud services
- **Tools:** Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit

## üîç Common Security Vulnerabilities

### **OWASP Top 10 (2021):**
1. **Broken Access Control:** Unauthorized access to resources
2. **Cryptographic Failures:** Weak encryption or key management
3. **Injection:** SQL, NoSQL, LDAP, OS command injection
4. **Insecure Design:** Flaws in application architecture
5. **Security Misconfiguration:** Default settings, unnecessary features
6. **Vulnerable Components:** Outdated libraries and frameworks
7. **Authentication Failures:** Weak authentication mechanisms
8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures:** Untrusted data sources
9. **Security Logging Failures:** Insufficient logging and monitoring
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Forced requests to internal resources
