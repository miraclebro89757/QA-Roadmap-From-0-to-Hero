# Git for QA

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code and documentation. For QA professionals, Git is essential for collaboration, traceability, and managing test automation projects.

## üéØ Why Learn Git as a QA?
- **Collaboration:** Work seamlessly with developers and other QAs
- **Traceability:** Track changes to test scripts, data, and documentation
- **Branching:** Safely experiment and manage multiple test efforts
- **History:** Audit changes and roll back if needed
- **Integration:** Essential for CI/CD and modern DevOps workflows

---

## üß© Key Git Concepts
- **Repository (Repo):** Project storage with version history
- **Commit:** A snapshot of changes
- **Branch:** Parallel line of development
- **Merge:** Combine changes from different branches
- **Remote:** A version of your repo hosted elsewhere (e.g., GitHub)
- **Pull Request (PR):** Propose and review changes before merging

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Use Cases for QA
- **Test Automation:** Version control for test scripts and frameworks
- **Test Data:** Track changes to test data files
- **Documentation:** Collaborate on test plans, cases, and bug reports
- **Experimentation:** Use branches for new tools, frameworks, or approaches
- **Collaboration:** Review and discuss changes with the team

## üìù Basic Git Commands
- `git clone <repo-url>`: Copy a remote repo locally
- `git status`: Show current changes
- `git add <file>`: Stage changes for commit
- `git commit -m "message"`: Save changes to history
- `git pull`: Update local repo from remote
- `git push`: Upload changes to remote
- `git branch`: List branches
- `git checkout <branch>`: Switch branches
- `git merge <branch>`: Merge another branch into current

## üì± Real-World Example: X (Twitter) QA with Git
- Manage automated test scripts for the X web app in a shared repo
- Use branches for new test features or bug fixes
- Collaborate on test documentation and bug reports
- Integrate Git with CI/CD for automated test execution
